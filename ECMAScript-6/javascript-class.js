//An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not.

//Class declarations, unlike function declarations, are not hoisted. Class declarations act like let declarations and so exist in the temporal dead zone until execution reaches the declaration.
//All code inside of class declarations runs in strict mode automatically. Thereâ€™s no way to opt-out of strict mode inside of classes.
//All methods are non-enumerable. This is a significant change from custom types, where you need to use Object.defineProperty() to make a method non-enumerable.
//All methods lack an internal [[Construct]] method and will throw an error if you try to call them with new.
//Calling the class constructor without new throws an error.
//Attempting to overwrite the class name within a class method throws an error.
